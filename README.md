As a data scientist in IBM, I have always been passionate about sharing my knowledge and helping others learn about the field. I believe that everyone should have the opportunity to learn about data science, regardless of their background or experience level. This belief has inspired me to become a learning content provider, creating and sharing educational materials that are accessible and engaging for everyone.

-------------------------------------------------------

Let's create a chatbot using Flask, LangChain and LLM that that will learn the contents of the PDF documents and will answer any questions you may have. In many organizations PDF documents contain a great deal of information. To make use of this information you have to read thousands of pages. Our chatbot will be your personal assistant powered by AI that will do the reading for you in seconds and will answer questions about what it had read.

In this project, you'll build a chatbot using Flask, LangChain and Large Language Model (LLM), capable of uploading and interpreting PDF documents. This could be a game-changer when you need quick access to information from extensive documents. For instance, if you're working with machinery and have thousands of pages of confidential instructions, this chatbot could provide immediate access to specific information while ensuring data privacy. Or, imagine having a specialized cookbook for a particular diet. You could quickly look up recipes based on the ingredients you have on hand.

You will also gain a deeper understanding of web application development using Flask and Python and the use of the LangChain framework in interpreting and responding to user inputs.
